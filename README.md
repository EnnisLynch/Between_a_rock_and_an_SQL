This code is a companion to the Ennis Codes video: Between a Rock and an SQL. Use the SQL in this project to create your tables and populate your tables. 

Note: I completely forgot to create these files before creating the video so the files might not actually run :) They should get you at least part way. If the files
don't work, it is a good exercise to create your own random sample data!
